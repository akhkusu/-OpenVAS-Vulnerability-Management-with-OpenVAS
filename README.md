 After setting up Windows 10 Pro also running on Azure VM, I installed outdated versions of Adobe Reader, Firefox, and VLC and disabled the firewall to make the machine intentionally vulnerable to attacks. I placed two machines in the same virtual network so that the OpenVAS server can reach the target(Win10) using a private IP address.

<br />

 In the report of the credential scan, vulnerabilities associated with the outdated software are displayed.
 Then, I erased the outdated software and enabled firewalls on Win10 to eliminate the vulnerabilities.
